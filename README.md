# 👋 Hi, I’m @sairakshith3698

- 👀 I’m deeply interested in building AI-powered products that enable business continuity, resilience, and secure decision-making at scale.
- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my product thinking through a Product Management Fellowship and mastering foundational AI/ML concepts—LLMs, RAG, prompt engineering, and agentic workflows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real-world product problems at the intersection of risk-tech, AI, and platform strategy—especially those where technical depth and decision velocity matter.
